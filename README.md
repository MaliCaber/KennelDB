<p>I've made this for personal use, it's an application that keeps information about your dogs. My family owns a dog kennel and we really needed digitize the dog documents for ease of use. It is still not done, haven't implemented a transactions in the sql queries so you can roll back in case of something going wrong, so if you use this be warned.</p>

<p>It's made using C# and SQLite database</p>
